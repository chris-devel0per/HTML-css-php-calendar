The Php script gets the current date and generates the dates for the next 4 years and will add radio buttons for the validation of the form . By clicking on the radio buttons on the right you will get 1 week forward . If you click the left one you will get 1 week back in time. The times are generated by php script and will check radio buttons by clicking on them .
